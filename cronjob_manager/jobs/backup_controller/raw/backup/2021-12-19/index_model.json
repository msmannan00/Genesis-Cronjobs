atm skimmers, the most popular method, come with pin, printed by us, best-quality - no previous owner of such card, very convenient, official visa and american express products - special type of pre-paid cards, no daily limits, unique on market, impossible to track - when it comes to purchasing cards - we understand every situation that may occur in life but you really have to be aware of scammers. - that stands behind every part of work - getting access to weakly protected corporative private networks gives us opportunity to distill thousands of cards. - we accept payments via bitcoin. - we have two main reasons to do so. - to answer this question we need to compare our cards. - yes, we keep an eye on credit cards that are in travel and if actual owner of card spends the money, we will inform you about this and we will send another credit card free of charge, using the fastest shipping available. - that's important rule we also would recommend you to follow. - it depends on your location. - we accept payments in bitcoins. - of course no! - however, if you are a public person, you shouldn't risk buying credit cards or pre-paid cards. - cards delievered and you're happy let the others know! - last comments: we add them as soon as we confirm transaction id - let us know the destination and expectations - we will match you a product and form of transport",

you: - 1the balance range you want. - 2the number of cards you want.discount on bulk orders - 3we will calculate your order value and get back to you as soon as possible. - 4then, we will tell you a secure way of sending us your shipping address. - 5and then we feed you with payment details. - do you have cards with huge balances,other than the one listed above - yes we do, but most at times we keep those cards to ourselves.feel free to ask - when will i recieve my cards - regular shipping takes 4-7 business days to arrive. - what payment methods do you accept. - at the moment we accept

transfer service through paypal or western union safe - of course, money sent from clean and verified accounts with no trace of the source of the money. - do you cash out the cards yourselves - yes, yet not every single one, that would be definitely unreasonable and too risky. - yes, if the card you received does not work for any reasons even though we check each card before it is sent we will refund you or send a replacement according to your choice. - what are the daily withdrawal limits from the cards - can i receive the digital information of the card without physical card - sure, you can tell us you want to the digital infomation of the card, we can send it to you through email. - is it possible to refill the prepaid card - every card has its own corresponding virtual bank account that we cannot give out due to security reasons. - what if i want to cash out in a different currency than usd - the cards' balances will get exchanged automatically basing on the current exchange rates, including a small fee that we can do nothing about. - how safe are those cards in reality - prepaid cards are absolutely zero-risk. - yes, prepaid cards are safe to use online. - you can go to

"m_description": "All transactions pass through the escrow service. - why are you selling cards why don't you cash out the cards yourselves - we do it. - how can i order cards - select and pay for. - what are the card balances - you can see balance of cards in our pricing list quickly! - the only form of payment we accept is bitcoin, to ensure the highest anonymity of both us and you. - where can i get bitcoins - you can buy them on various bitcoin marketplaces on clearnet. - can i use the cards online - yes, visa / master card / american express prepaid cards working very well with online stores, atms, offline stores. - can i receive the dumps of the cards digitally - we will encrypt the email and send you the details of the card in there. - what if i want to cash out in a different currency than usd - the cards' balances will get exchanged automatically basing on the current exchange rates, including a small fee that we can do nothing about. - how do i get pin - every card comes with it's 4 digit pin written separately on a piece of paper. - how safe are those cards in reality - visa / master card / american express prepaid cards are absolutely zero-risk, yet you don't even need to hide your identity that much when using them. - do i need to give you my full address - you do not necessarily have to order them straight to your door. - you can pay btc wallet: 19ibnod4rdqddyddyxoyvgbwf1teg7g6r5 after payment, send the transaction number and shipping address. - what is the expiration date of those cards - visa prepaid cards should last 2-3 years. - is it possible to refill the prepaid card - technically it would be possible, but we won't do it.", "m_doc_url": [], "m_images": [], "m_sub_url":
